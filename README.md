# LittleChat

## Introduction

LittleChat is a real time web chat app based on firebase.

## Notes

* Before start, go to `/functions` and do `npm install` to install packages in `package.json`.
* After setting up the user sign-in, I need to "OAuth consent screen" to finish the setup before the "Google sign-in window" kicks in.
