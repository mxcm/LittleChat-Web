# Firebase Web Codelab - Start code

This folder contains the starting code for the [Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

If you'd like to jump directly to the end and see the finished code head to the [web](../web) directory.

## Notes

* Before start, go to `/functions` and do `npm install` to install packages in `package.json`.
* After setting up the user sign-in, I need to "OAuth consent screen" to finish the setup before the "Google sign-in window" kicks in.
